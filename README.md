# Youtube-Scrape-using-Youtube-API



This is to scrape youtube comments from the latest video that has been uploaded.
I use channel Fireship for the example of this code
it will read the video_id of the latest video that has been uploaded and scrape all the comments
then the result will be imported into a csv file
