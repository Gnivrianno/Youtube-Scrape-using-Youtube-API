And even though you can type-anotate the arguments of your function, that only tells the compiler which optimizations to make for that type. For example, one thing you can do in julia is to define your own number type with something like `struct MyNumber &lt;: Number end` and just define some base methods for `MyNumber`, the instances of it will magically behave like a julia Number."

Case in point, I wanted to use an automatic differentiation library with an interval arithmetic library. Because the autodiff library works works on the Real supertype, interval arithmetic works seamlessly with it even though the two Julia packages themselves are written independently. <br><br>Very often, everything &quot;just works&quot;. When it doesn&#39;t, you can define new methods without breaking existing functionality. Try to do that in an object-oriented language without having to define a bunch of new methods for your object."

It looks weird at first, but when you get into it it makes a lot of sense. For one thing, curly braces get reserved for some parts of type declaration, and so using them for functions and structs and stuff would get confusing very easily. Also, having &quot;end&quot; gives the benefits of python&#39;s &quot;plain English&quot; appearance without succumbing to the royal pain that is indentation errors. There are also benefits in that it makes Julia look a bit distinctive, although that is a minor benefit. Overall, &quot;end&quot; just makes sense for Julia and the way it is intended to be used"
